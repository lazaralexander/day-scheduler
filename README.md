# Day Scheduler

## Description

In this project we were tasked with creating a day scheduler/planner. Using bootstrap, jQuery, Moment.js, and some starter code provided to us, I created a planner that allows the user to save their tasks throughout the work day.

# Assingment Details

## User Story

AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively


## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
